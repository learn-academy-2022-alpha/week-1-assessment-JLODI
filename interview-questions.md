# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

  Your answer:

  Git is a storage system for code that lets developers save and track their coding project files. Github is the online storage website that utilizes the git technology with a visual interface, which lets developers track multiple projects, browse the repository files and allows developers to code collaboratively online while also tracking the change history of any file.  Github are invaluable tools for developers and is an industry standard tool for web developers. I've had 5 years of experience working with github and a GUI application called Sourcetree at my level design job at Jam City. We used it keep our editor application up to date and submit and collaborate on level designs. Only recently through LEARN Academy, I have learned how to interface with github through terminal commands, but it's very quick to use.

  Researched answer:
  Git is a version tracking software used for code development. Git tracks the changes made to files with a change history and is typically used for collaborative development and has the benefits of quick efficiency, data integrity, and non-linear workflow. While git is the software itself, github is the web-based platform that uses that software online, allowing the collaborative development over the web.



2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

  Your answer:

  A javascript boolean value is binary and is either a true or false value. The operator checks if two or more values are compared with a relational question and if it's true or false to the question. Boolean operators include equality ==, strict equality ===, greater than >, or less than.I'm familiar with the boolean operators when checking for a true or false between two values in a conditional statement for example.

  Researched answer:
  A javascript boolean value can only be one of two qualities: true or false. Operators that return these boolean values of true or false are equality operators == "loose equality" and === "strict equality", relational operators: > greater than, < less than, >= greater than or equal to, less than or equal to <=, as well as logical operators: && which is "and", || which is "or", ! which is not. For example, when comparing two values, an argument would be written out as "this thing" (operator) "this thing" and checks if it's true or false for the boolean value.


3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

  Your answer:

  An index is the numbered location of a character or number within a value such as a string or array while a value is the actual data itself such a string, like a word or sentence or numbers. Javascript automatically assigns an index number to any value and always starts the count at 0. For example, in the string "hello", the letter "e" has the index of 1 even though it is in the second position as we see humans recognize it. I am still learning the basic concepts of index numbers, but they seem very handy for picking out a portion or character of data or for cutting off certain data with accessors and mutators.

  Researched answer:
  The index indicates the placement of an element within an array or string. Arrays are "0 indexed" meaning that the index will start counting from the first position as "0". So the count goes from 0,1,2,3,4 and so forth. In a string, the index will assign a number to each character (starting from 0), from left to right, such as "apple", a is index 0, p is index 1, etc. While in an array, an index number will be assigned to each value in the array. For example, if an array has a collection of strings such as ["apple", "banana", "pear"], then the string "apple" will be at index 0, "banana" at index 1, and "pear" at index 2



4. What is iteration?

  Your answer:
  Iteration is repeating a procedure and in best practice a set number of times or when a condition is met, and can be met to prevent an infinite loop. In javascript, we use loops to iterate a function to be run through the for let loop: "for as long as this is in this condition, until it's not in this condition, then run the function for the next increment". The for loop is very useful for running a function for each data in an array. It's also in best practice to keep your code "dry"
(don't repeat yourself), so it lets you run a function you've already typed out once without having to manually retype or copy/paste that function yourself.

  Researched answer:
  Iteration is executing a block of code until a specified condition is met.  Iteration is useful for running existing code while "keeping your code dry" (not rewriting lines of code keeping it concise and efficient). Iteration is a very useful tool to interact with arrays.


5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:

  Proper pair programming involves two people collaboratively coding together. One is designated as the driver, who does all the typing of code and the other is designated as the navigator, who tells the driver what to type. For successful paired programming, neither work on their own and stay within the job of their role, which favors constant communication between both driver and navigator. The practice helps offload the effort required for coding, splitting the work between two roles, and helps with catching typos and mistakes. It also helps with how to approach a problem by communicating with your partner. It's advised to switch roles off every 20 minutes which also allows us to properly practice pushing and pulling from Github.

  Researched answer:
  Proper pair programming is two people working on one code source for one application, with two different roles assigned: a driver and a navigator. The driver types the code, while the navigator guides the driver by telling them what to type. The idea of pair programming is to cover more ground for specialization, distribute cognitive load, avoid shortcuts and to stay focused on the task. Pair programming helps strengthen your communication which is the most important quality as a developer and to be able to talk through any issues while problem-solving.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:

Higher Order functions seem to be function that performs something at a higher authorization level, such as creating a new function or changing another one.

2. Jest:
Jest seems to be a a javascript testing application, a QA tool to check if the code is stable and ready for deployment.

3. Objects:
An object is a concept that has multiple values and properties, like a collection of functions?

4. Method:
A method is a type of function that is associated with an object and in syntax is used as <functionname>.methodname() . For example: "built-in method" refers to a function where the value to run the function is optional (you can leave the value blank)

5. Classes:
Classes are templates for javascript functions
